Display a Floating Banner Advert Rotator Box at the Bottom of Your Site. Track Advertising Banner Views, Clicks and More or add Custom HTML.

== Description ==

Display a Floating Banner Advert Rotator Box at the Bottom of Your Site. Track Banner Views, Clicks and Clickthroughs or add Custom Banner Tracking HTML from External Services.

Each time someone visits your site a banner advert will be chosen at random and be shown. Adverts will only be shown once per session to avoid being distracting.

**Ideal for Split Testing**

This plugin works great with split testing banner adverts. In the admin area it lists each banner with statistics for views, clicks and clickthroughs.

**Affiliate Adverts and Affiliate Marketing**

Clear placement on the page where site visitors will see your affiliate advertisements.

**Add Custom HTML**

*As of Version 1.2 Custom HTML is filtered using [HTMLawed 1.2.beta](http://www.bioinformatics.org/phplabware/internal_utilities/htmLawed/) Licensed under LGPL v3 and GPL v2+*

If you don't want to use our banner uploader you can use your own custom HTML.

**Only Displays Advert Once Per Visit**

This plugin makes use of session storage within the users browser to only display the advert once each time they visit. This makes sure it doesn\'t appear whenever they refresh the page or open a new page or post.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**Is there a limit to the number of banner I can upload and rotate?**

*No - But we\'d recommend that you limit the number to around 5 so each banner gets seen frequently*

**Is this plugin suitable for split testing?**

*Yes - You can upload a number of banners promoting the same service and the stats will allow you to find out which has the best click through rate*

**Can I use tracking links with my own banners?**

*Yes - With each banner you upload you also specify a URL to link the banner to, this can be a tracking URL. Alternatively some custom tracking code is supported in the HTML input section.*

**Can I use a Third Party Banner Rotator?**

*Probably - This should work but the HTML allowed in the custom HTML textarea is limited. If you have any problems with custom banner rotator HTML just submit a support request with the HTML you\'re trying to use*
